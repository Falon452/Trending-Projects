The app allows users to **choose a creation date** for a repository. A project is considered **trending** when it has **over 100 stars**.  
The **default creation date** is **one week ago**.  

GitHub API does not provide an endpoint for trending repositories. Therefore, I made the assumption that **repositories with over 100 stars** are considered trending.  

### Project Details display the following information:  
- **Number of stars**  
- **Owner name**  
- **Repository name**  
- **Description**  
- ⭐ **README.md** 

**Adhered to Material Design 3.**  

## 🎉 Animations 🎉  

- 🚀 **Splash Screen Animation**: Shrink + Fade Out ✨  
- 🌗 **Shimmers**: Supports both **dark mode** & **light mode** 💡  
- ⭐🔄 **[Shared Element Transition](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/animation/shared-elements)**: Smooth animation when clicking on a project 🎬⭐

⚠️Very large READMEs crashed the application, so I set a limit of 1,000 lines for the README to be displayed.
